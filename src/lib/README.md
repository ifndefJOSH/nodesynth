# FFT Library

A tiny FFT library for use in Nodesynth. This library makes a few assumptions:

1. The buffer size is a power of two
2. The inputs are either real-valued double precision floating point numbers or `complex` as defined by `<complex.h>`

Use it as you will. I need to optimize this better.
